API BUILDING GUIDE

PART ONE - BUILDING THE PROJECT FOUNDATIONS

1 - Install EXPRESS GENERATOR - this will provide an express project template. <npm i express-generator>
2 - Run the generator to start the project - specify that the project won't have any embedded views on it
    <express --view=no-view javascript-notes-api>
3 - Run <npm install> to install all the needed dependencies

4 - Clean project. Remove from app.js (both the requirement and the calls):
     - cookieParser (the project doesn't have integrated views)
     - index route (the same reason)

5 - Create app folder to gather all the app information: routes, configs, etc
